# About Me :

Hi! I'm Regina, a junior full-stack developer, actively working on my tech skills with hands-on projects. 

As a career changer, I put a lot of importance on learning and I believe everything is achievable with the right mindset. 🌱

As a person, I am also passionate about animals, memes, and competitive board games 😄.

Let’s connect, chat and build somnething together!
